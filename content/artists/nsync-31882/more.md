*NSYNC, in addition to the dubious honor of having an asterisk in their name, rendering them a complete pain for web site managers around the world, built a truly muddy version of "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays".  

Points in their favor - it's a new, original song, and only rarely covered after. 

The video is delightfully dated but the words are unintelligibable.
