"Carol of the Bells" is also known as the "Ringing of the Bells"

I'm going to call an audible on this one, [Pentatonix]({{< ref "pentatonix-655231">}}) absolutely kills it with their kicking version. 

For a really sweet sentiment, it sure does get overproduced, becoming synomous with too much whipped cream. 

[First written in 1914 in Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_of_the_Bells), updated in 1936 for the NBC Symphony Orchestra.  

> The carol is metrically bistable, and a listener can focus on either measure or switch between them.  

It's hard to hear that with the massive real or electronic strings section swirling around.

The Muppets, of course also do a fantastic version:
