# It's the most popular song ... of the year

An instrumental written by Leroy Anderson in July, 1946, during a heat wave, with lyrics added in 1950 by Mitchell Parish.  Oddly used as the main theme for a western movie, [Streets of Laredo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041929/), in 1949.  

The sound effects make this song - the clip-clop of horse's hooves and the wippah of the slapstick give us all something to look forward to.  

Covered by over 11 artists in this survey alone, it really belongs to [The Ronnettes]({{< ref "the-ronettes-89545">}}) and [Johnny Mathis]({{< ref "johnny-mathis-14581">}}) for vocals, and the [Boston Pops Orchestra]({{< ref "boston-pops-orchestra-136372">}}) for the instrumental. 

It's upbeat, fast paced and has nothing specifically to do with Christmas!
